# Tuning Configuration
# This file contains all speed/timing constants for easy adjustment.
# Values here override defaults in default_config.yaml.

# =============================================================================
# MOUSE MOVEMENT SPEED
# =============================================================================
mouse:
  # Base movement speed in pixels per second
  # Higher = faster mouse movements
  speed_range: [800, 1400]

  # Speed variation during movement (makes acceleration/deceleration visible)
  speed_variation:
    enabled: true
    # Min/max speed multipliers during a single movement
    # 0.2 = 5x slower, 1.5 = 1.5x faster than base
    min_speed_factor: 0.2
    max_speed_factor: 1.5
    # Random speed bursts (sudden accelerations)
    burst_chance: 0.15           # 15% chance per movement
    burst_speed_multiplier: 1.8  # How much faster during burst
    burst_duration_ratio: 0.15   # Portion of path affected by burst
    # Micro-pauses during movement
    micro_pause:
      chance: 0.25               # 25% chance per movement
      duration: [0.03, 0.12]     # Duration range in seconds

# =============================================================================
# CLICK TIMING
# =============================================================================
timing:
  # Herb cleaning (between clicks)
  click_herb_mean: 250      # Target average delay (ms)
  click_herb_std: 75        # Standard deviation
  click_herb_min: 150       # Absolute minimum

  # Bank actions
  bank_action_mean: 800
  bank_action_std: 200
  bank_action_min: 500
  bank_action_max: 1500

  # Post-action delays
  after_bank_open: 400
  after_deposit: 300
  after_withdraw: 300
  after_bank_close: 200

# =============================================================================
# CLICK BEHAVIOR
# =============================================================================
click:
  # Position randomization within target
  # Higher = clicks closer to center, lower = more spread
  position_sigma_ratio: 6

  # Click hold duration (ms)
  duration_mean: 100
  duration_min: 50
  duration_max: 200

# =============================================================================
# HERB CLEANING BEHAVIOR
# =============================================================================
cleaning:
  skip_herb_chance: 0.05        # Chance to skip to next herb

  hesitation:
    enabled: true
    chance: 0.15                # Chance of hesitation movements
    movements: [1, 3]           # Range of extra movements

  missed_click:
    correction_delay: [0.15, 0.35]  # Reaction time before correction (seconds)

  # Post-click micro-drift (subtle mouse movement after clicking)
  # Simulates natural hand tremor/movement that occurs after clicking
  post_click_drift:
    enabled: true
    chance: 0.6                 # 60% of clicks have drift
    distance: [1, 4]            # Pixels to drift

# =============================================================================
# MOUSE PATH CHARACTERISTICS
# =============================================================================
path:
  # Overshoot (going past target then correcting)
  overshoot_chance: 0.3
  overshoot_distance: [5, 15]   # Pixels past target

  # Curve shape variance (higher = more curved paths)
  curve_variance: 0.3

  # Hand jitter near click target
  jitter:
    enabled: true
    radius: [1.0, 3.0]          # Jitter magnitude in pixels
    points: 3                   # Number of jitter movements

  # Path imperfections
  imperfection:
    enabled: true
    simple_curve_chance: 0.15   # Chance of simpler curve
    control_point_variance: 0.2
    micro_correction:
      chance: 0.3
      magnitude: [2.0, 8.0]     # Pixels of deviation

# =============================================================================
# INVENTORY TRAVERSAL PATTERNS
# =============================================================================
# Randomize the order in which inventory slots are clicked for human-like behavior.
# A new pattern is selected randomly each time a fresh inventory is withdrawn.

traversal:
  # Which patterns are enabled (randomly selected each inventory)
  # Available patterns:
  #   row_ltr, row_rtl, row_ltr_bottom, row_rtl_bottom
  #   col_ttb, col_btt, col_ttb_right, col_btt_right
  #   zigzag_horizontal, zigzag_vertical
  #   spiral_inward
  #   weighted_nearest (prefers slots closer to mouse position)
  enabled_patterns:
    - row_ltr
    - row_rtl
    - zigzag_horizontal
    - zigzag_vertical
    - col_ttb
    - weighted_nearest

  # Weights for pattern selection (higher = more likely)
  # Patterns not listed default to weight 1.0
  pattern_weights:
    row_ltr: 0.5              # Less common (too predictable)
    row_rtl: 1.0
    zigzag_horizontal: 1.5
    zigzag_vertical: 1.0
    col_ttb: 1.0
    weighted_nearest: 2.0     # Most human-like, weighted highest
