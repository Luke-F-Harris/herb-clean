1. Bot detection prevention
  - Mouse jitter when clicking or about to click //
  - None perfect bezier-curves when moving //
  - Randomize speed while moving in a bezier-curve (nonconstant speed during bezier-curve movement) //
  - When moving to a place to click, sometimes move a couple more times within the click box before or after clicking //
  - The wait between clicks when cleaning herbs is too slow. //
  - Sometimes skip a herb when cleaning //
  - Sometimes miss a click when cleaning herbs, never do this when on the first or last row of herbs. //
  - Do not use the same inventory route each time, currently we go left to right, then next row, left to right, 
  repeat. We need to randomize the traversal. //
  
  - Randomize the choice between clicking one of the cleaned herbs or the deposit button when depositing herbs.
  - Implement overshooting and undershooting when moving to click on boxes. This should happen 5% of the time.
  - Sometimes 'accidentally' drag a herb instead of clicking it, this should happen 5% of the time. When this happens, we should drag the herb toward an adjacent cell in the inventory. This should only happen when we are not on the first or last row of herbs.
  - Occasionally check the herblore skill by going to the 'skills' tab and hovering over the herblore skill. This should be a pretty rare event. After hovering over the skill for a few seconds (3-8), go back to the inventory tab. I will add the skill_tab.png and inventory_tab.png files.
